Sphinx 2 is one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source large
vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition
engine. The licensing terms for the Sphinx engines and tools are derived
from BSD, and based, in particular, upon the license for the Apache web
server. There is no restriction against commercial use or
redistribution. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

The packages that the CMU Sphinx Group is releasing are a set of
reasonably mature, world-class speech components that provide a basic
level of technology to anyone interested in creating speech-using
applications without the once-prohibitive initial investment cost in
research and development; the same components are open to peer review by
all researchers in the field, and are used for linguistic research as
well.

Note however that Sphinx is not a final product. Those with a certain
level of expertise can achieve great results with the versions of Sphinx
available here, but a naive user will certainly need further help. In
other words, the software available here is not meant for users with no
experience in speech, but for expert users.
