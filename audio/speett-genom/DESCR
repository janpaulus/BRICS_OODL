speett stands for "speech to text". This is a english speech recognition module
based on the Sphinx2 speech recognition engine. See
http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ for details.

As it is, the module uses the accoustic model bundled with sphinx2 and must
import a user-defined language model to be useful. A (very simple) sample model
is included in the module distribution for reference and tests purposes.
