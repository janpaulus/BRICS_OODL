OpenHRP (Open Architecture Humanoid Robotics Platform) is an integrated
simulation platform for mainly a robot and consists of main dynamics algorithm
developed by Nakamura Lab, Graduate School of Information Science and
Technology Department of Mechano-Informatics in the University of Tokyo, a
graphical user interface developed by General Robotix,Inc and others by
Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).

Using OpenHRP, users can inspect an original robot model and control program by
dynamics simulation. In addition, OpenHRP provides various model calculation
libraries that users can use in software development of a robot.

OpenHRP is designed as the distributed object system, consists of the server
program group which offers various functions and the client program for
managing the server. By this constitution, it has improved the conservativeness
and portability in large-scale simulation system developing.
