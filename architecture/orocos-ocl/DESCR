The Orocos Component Library is a set of basic component, build on top of the
Orocos RTT. It contains in particular the following components :

	- Reporting
		Components to report the data flow between components to the console or a
		file. The reporter components can be configured to report the data flow at
		specific data ports of a component, or to report all to data flow from and 
		to a component at once.

	- Taskbrowser
		A text oriented user interface for online interaction with components.
		The taskbrowser allows you to interact with a component through its task
		context interface: call methods and commands, handle properties and data 
		ports, etc. This is your main tool during component development, testing 
		or experimenting

	- Deployment
		Component for connecting and configuring an application.
