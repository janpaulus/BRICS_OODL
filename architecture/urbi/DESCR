Urbi includes a C++ component library called UObject that comes with a
robot standard API to describe motors, sensors and algorithms. Next to
UObject, you can use the urbiscript orchestration script language to
glue the components together and describe high level behaviors, a bit
like python or LUA, but with embedded parallel and event-driven
semantics to make the job easier.  The goal of Urbi is to help making
robots compatible, and simplify the process of writing programs and
behaviors for those robots. The range of potential applications of
Urbi goes beyond robotics, since it has been successfully used in
generic complex systems, where parallel and event-driven orchestration
on multiple agents is the rule
