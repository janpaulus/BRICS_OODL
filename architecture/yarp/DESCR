YARP stands for Yet Another Robot Platform. What is it? If data is the
bloodstream of your robot, then YARP is the circulatory system. It isn't the
brain. It isn't the heart. But it is pretty useful to have around all the
same.

More specifically, YARP supports building a robot control system as a
collection of programs communicating in a peer-to-peer way, with a family of
connection types that meet the diverse, sometimes contradictory, and always
changing needs of advanced robotics.
