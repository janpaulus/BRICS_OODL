The RT-Middleware provides a common platform for the robotics technology
and aims at boosting the efficiency of the research and development in
robotics, extending the scope of its applications and fostering the
emergence of new markets. A serious problem often pointed out in the
development of software  supporting robotic systems compared to the
development of traditional software is the lack of reuse due to the
specificity of each robotic system. From this observation, the idea
emerged of developing a middleware as the common platform to assist in
the development of robotic systems in which a large number of users could
be involved and which would promote reusability via the modularization of
the software involved in the realization of the robotic technology.

The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology -
Intelligent Systems Research Institute - Task Intelligence Research
Group, have undertaken most of the development of OpenRTM-aist.

Initially, the project for the research and development of a distributed
middleware for robotics took place from fiscal year 2002 to 2004 as a
part of the 21st century robot challenge program called Development of
the key enabling technologies for Robotics directed by the New Energy and
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

This research project resulted in several specifications of at the
distributed middleware interface level and the delivery of of a prototype
implementation named OpenRTM-aist.
