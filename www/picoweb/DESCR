Picoweb - a dedicated HTTP server for GenoM modules

Picoweb is an HTTP server designed to make the contents of the posters
created by GenoM modules available as XML documents to applications
like user interfaces, debugging software, or control/supervision
software. 
This is not a general purpose web server. 

Every Genom Module provides a CGI procedure that exports its posters
in XML, as part of its client library. Picoweb is able to autoload the
client library of an exiting module when it receives a request for its
CGI procedure. 

By default, picoweb listens on the 8080 port and outputs logging
information to stdout.
