Alog is a simple log data viewing tool. It can be used in many
different situations, but is particularly useful with GenoM
modules. Each module can print some debugging or progress information
to its standard output during the execution of its codels. Alog
provides a mean to capture this information and centralize it into one
single window, with functions to hide/show some module's output and
search capabilities.
