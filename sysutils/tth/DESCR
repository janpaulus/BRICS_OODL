TTH translates TEX, the predominant mark-up language for expressing
mathematics, into HTML, the language of world-wide-web browsers. It thereby
enables mathematical documents to be made available on the web. Document
structure, using either the Plain or LaTeX macro packages, is also translated
and incorporated in the form of hyperlinks.

TTH is extremely fast and completely portable. It produces more compact, faster
viewing, web documents than other converters, because it really translates the
equations, instead of converting them to images.
