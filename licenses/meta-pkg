This package is a collection of several other packages. It installs no files by
itself, but rather relies on the dependency mechanism to have all the software
from the collection installed.

The meta-package by itself does not have any license since it has no file, but
every package from the collection has its own individual license, which you
might accept or reject on an individual basis.

Note that rejecting any license of a package in the collection will prevent the
meta-package to install, unless the latter has some option to enable or disable
individual components.
