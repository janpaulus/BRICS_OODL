This package contains classes representing robots, humanoid robots,
joints and bodies with

 * dynamic properties (mass, inertia, velocity, acceleration,...) that
   are implemented through robot dynamics abstract interfaces,

 * geometric properties (kinematic chain, distance to obstacles) that are
   implemented by KineoWorks(tm).
