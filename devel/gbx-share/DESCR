Gearbox is a collection of software tools which could be integrated into
complete robotic systems with one of many software integration
frameworks. GearBox is not a framework and thus does not compete with any
existing or future frameworks. It does not contain any "glue" code to help you
assemble a complete system.

This package contains the cmake files installed by Gearbox that are common
to all Gearbox packages.
