Boost is a set of free, peer-reviewed, C++ libraries.  The emphasis is on
portable libraries which work well with the ISO C++ Standard Library.
A separate Sandbox CVS is available for Boost developers wishing to
collaborate on projects prior to formal acceptance of a new library. 

This package provides boost-sandbox header files that contain bindings to
lapack and blas libraries.
