hppCorbaServer implements a Corba interface with hppCore package. Corba
requests can be sent to trigger actions in a ChppPlanner object. Three
main Corba interfaces are implemented:

    * ChppciRobot: to build a ChppDevice and to insert it in a ChppPlanner object,
    * ChppciObstacle: to build obstacles and insert them in a ChppPlanner object,
    * ChppciProblem: to define a path planning problem and solve it.

However, the main interface classes for users of this package are

    * ChppciServer that implements the above Corba interfaces
    * ChppciOpenHrpClient that implements a Corba client to load HRP2
      model (installed on request see INSTALL file for instructions).
