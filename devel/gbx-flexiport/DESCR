Gearbox is a collection of software tools which could be integrated into
complete robotic systems with one of many software integration
frameworks. GearBox is not a framework and thus does not compete with any
existing or future frameworks. It does not contain any "glue" code to help you
assemble a complete system.

This package contains the FlexiPort data communications library.
It provides a consistent interface for communicating over a range of data port
types. Currently serial and TCP ports are supported. Support for USB ports is
planned for when I get a suitable USB device to test with. Logging is possible,
which allows communications sessions to be played back at a later date without
the original hardware present.
