Mkdep is a tool to manage dependencies for make(1) automatically on
Unix-like systems. The original feature of this version is to be able to
handle incremental updates of the dependencies.

This version of mkdep was originally written by Christophe Dousson,
during his PhD thesis at CNRS-LAAS. It is now maintained by Matthieu
Herrb and made available under a BSD-style license.
