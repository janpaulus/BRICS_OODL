roboptim is a C++ generic non-linear optimization library for robotics composed of 3
levels:
  - core
  - posture
  - trajectory

The core level allows users to define non-linear optimization problems
in a generic way in order to use different back-ends. Currently the
supported solvers are
  * cfsqp
  * ipopt

A non-linear optimization problem can be expressed as follows:

  min f(x), x in R^n, Ce(x) = 0, Ci(x)<= 0

where 
  - f is a scalar mapping defined over R^n, 
  - Ce (equality constraints) is a mapping from R^n to R^m,
  - Ci (inequality constraint) is a mapping from R^n to R^p.
