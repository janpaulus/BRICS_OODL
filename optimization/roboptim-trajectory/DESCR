roboptim is a C++ generic non-linear optimization library for robotics composed of 3
levels:
  - core
  - posture
  - trajectory

The trajectory level, proposes an extendable set of classes aiming at
casting optimal control problems into non-linear optimization problems
that can be numerically solved by solvers interfaced with the core level.
