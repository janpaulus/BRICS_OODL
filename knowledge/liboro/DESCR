liboro is a C++ bridge for the oro-server ontology server.

It allows direct access to the server RPC methods (to add, remove statements, 
query the ontology, etc.) as well as an object-oriented wrapper that eases the 
creation and retrieval of objects.

liboro fully supports the oro-server event system, and event callback can 
easily be added to trigger behaviours when certains facts can be inferred is 
from the robot's cognitive model.
