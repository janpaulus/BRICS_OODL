oro-alterite is a plugin for oro-server.

It allows multiple cognitive models to be created by the robot (typically, one 
per agent the robot knows).

Each model must be consistent to be useful (ie, to enable reasonning), but two
model may be inconsistent to each other. For instance, one given object may be 
visible for one agent and currently invisible to the robot.
