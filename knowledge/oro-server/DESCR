oro-server focuses on the implementation of a representation framework for 
general robots' knowledge, along with a library of basic, reusable cognitive 
functions. This so-called cognitive kernel is actually build as a server that 
maps cognitive service to a ontology-based backend.

Amongst other features, these base cognitive functions include:

* Easy addition or removal of statements on the world (ie, truths for the 
robot's model): add [aibo sees green_bottle],
* Arbitrary complex queries, based on SPARQL:
find robots [?robots sees ?object, ?object hasShape cylinder] [?robot hasWeight > 100],
* Classification, rules application, first logic order reasonning on the set 
of statements, through the Pellet library.
* Possibility to assign to statements memory profiles that cause the robot to 
forget such facts after a predefinied amount of time,
* Event system that triggers subscribed listeners, for instance when a fact 
becomes a true or a new object is discovered,
* Categorization skills to find similarities or differences between concepts,
* Explicit representation of other agents own world models (a bottle can be 
half full for the robot and half empty for another agent)
