`tnftp' is a portable version of the NetBSD ftp client, hence the name.

tnftp (formerly known as lukemftp) is a port of the NetBSD FTP client to other
systems. It offers many enhancements over the traditional BSD FTP client,
including command-line editing, command-line fetches of FTP and HTTP URLs
(including via proxies), command-line uploads of FTP URLs, context-sensitive
word completion, dynamic progress bar, IPv6 support, modification time
preservation, paging of local and remote files, passive mode support (with
fallback to active mode), SOCKS support, TIS FWTK gate-ftp server support, and
transfer rate throttling. tnftp is the default FTP client found in FreeBSD,
MacOS X, NetBSD, and SuSE Linux.
