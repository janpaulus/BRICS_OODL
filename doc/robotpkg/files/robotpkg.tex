\chapter{The robotpkg user's guide}
\label{chapter:user}

Basically, there are two ways of using robotpkg.  The  first is to only install
the  package tools and to  use binary packages that  someone else has prepared.
The second way is  to install the  programs from source. Then  you are  able to
build your own packages,  and you can  still use  binary packages from  someone
else. Sections in this document will detail both approaches where appropriate.
