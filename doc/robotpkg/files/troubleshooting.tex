In this chapter, we list some common failure cases and explain how to solve them.

\subsubsection*{Dependency not found at installation.}
After typing {\tt make install} in a directory, installation fails at the configuration step of a package because {\tt pkg-config} cannot find a dependency although this dependency is encoded in {\tt robotpkg} Makefiles.

\paragraph{Possible reason.} The missing package has been deleted by {\tt robotpkg\_delete} but {\tt make clean} has not been run in the corresponding directory. As a result, a new {\tt make install} command in this directory has no effect since everything seems up to date. 

\paragraph{Solving the problem.} Before installing or reinstalling packages, it is wise to run {\tt make clean} in {\tt robotpkg} root directory.
