The C++ Config File library is used for reading and writing configuration / .ini files. The Config component provides fully customizable delimiters and comment characters, ensuring compatability with most existing config/ini file formats. It allows multiline values using backslash escapes. Comments within the config file are fully preserved when the contents are re-saved. Furthermore, deleted values can become commented out when the object is re-saved - preserving old data.
