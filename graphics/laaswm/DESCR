laaswm is a modified version of evilwm, to allow remote control of windows.

evilwm 1.0 by Ciaran Anscomb <evilwm@6809.org.uk>

evilwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

The name evil came from Stuart 'Stuii' Ford, who thinks that any software
I use must be evil and masochistic.  In reality, this window manager is
clean and easy to use.


FEATURES

 * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
 * Solid window drags (compile time option - may be slow on old machines).
 * Virtual desktops.
 * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).
