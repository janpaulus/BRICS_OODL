PCAN-Light for LINUX is the easy to use Software Interface for
PEAK-System CAN-Hardware.

The PCAN drivers for LINUX work with Kernel Version 2.4 up to Kernel
2.6.26. The complete package is distributed under the GPL

The API (Application Programming Interface) for the different PCAN-PC
hardware is the same. This make it easy to develop software which work
with different PEAK CAN-Hardware Interface. But be carefull while
using these drivers with non PEAK CAN PC Hardware. The PEAK-CAN
Hardware Moduls and drivers use special fiunctions which are only
running with a 100% compatible PCAN-PEAK Hardware.
