Gearbox is a collection of software tools which could be integrated into
complete robotic systems with one of many software integration
frameworks. GearBox is not a framework and thus does not compete with any
existing or future frameworks. It does not contain any "glue" code to help you
assemble a complete system.

This package contains the Hokuyo URG laser scanner driver.
It provides a driver for Hokuyo laser scanner devices using the SCIP protocol
version 1 or 2. It has been tested with the Hokuyo URG-04LX, UBG-04LX, UHG-08LX
and UTM-30LX but it should work with any scanner that conforms to these
protocol versions, including the URG-04LX-F01, the URG-04LX-UG01 (Simple-URG),
and the UXM-30LX (Tough-URG).
