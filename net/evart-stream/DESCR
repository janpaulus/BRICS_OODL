EVa Real-Time Software (EVaRT) provides a user with a simple and powerful
interface to the Motion Analysis(tm) motion capture hardware. Under a
single software environment you can set up, calibrate, capture motion in
real-time, capture motion for post processing, edit and save data in the
format of your choice.

evart-stream connects to the EVaRT(tm) motion capture software through an
SDK and listen to the network for data streaming requests.
