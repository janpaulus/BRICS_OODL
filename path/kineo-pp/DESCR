KineoWorks is an on-the-shelf software component dedicated to motion
planning.  Developed by Kineo CAM, it benefits from years of research
conducted at LAAS, a lab of the French Institutes for Scientific Research
CNRS. It enables 'automatic motion' of any mechanical system or virtual
artefact in a 3D environment in a realistic way, which means managing
collision avoidance and kinematical constraints of the system.  The
KineoWorks APIs have been designed to be easy to integrate in any
software.
