hppWalkPlanner implements a two step algorithm for planning paths for a
humanoid robot.

    * The first step consists in computing collision-free path for the
      robot bounding box with a cart-like kinematics.
    * In the second step a dynamically balanced walk motion is produced
      about the above path using a walk pattern generator (walkGenJRL).
