This package implements collision free walk path planning for a humanoid robot.
The robot is represented by a bounding box moving in the plane. Path planning
is performed in two steps:
 * first a collision free path is built for the bounding box, the default
   steering method is ChppWalkSteeringMethod,
 * then sequences of step sequences are computed along the path of the box.

To use this package see the documentation of the main class ChppWalkFootPlanner.
