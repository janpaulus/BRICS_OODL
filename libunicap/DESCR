The Sick LIDAR Matlab/C++ Toolbox is an open-source software package released under a BSD Open-Source License that provides stable and easy-to-use C++ drivers for Sick LMS 2xx and Sick LD laser range finders. In addition to low-level drivers, the package also features an easy to use Mex interface, which allows the end-user to stream real-time range and reflectivity data directly into Matlab. This feature is especially attractive as it facilitates the rapid development of algorithms by exploiting the high-level functionality afforded by Matlab's vector-based operations. 

Toolbox Features
    * Multi-threaded Sick LMS 2xx C++ driver (RS-232/422)
          o Data Acquisition: Acquire raw range and/or reflectivity returns, mean measured values, interlaced scans, and more...
          o Configure: Set variant (field-of-view and scan resolution), measuring units, measuring mode, availability level, and more...
    * Multi-threaded Sick LD C++ driver (TCP/IP via BSD Sockets)
          o Data Acquisition: Acquire raw range and reflectivity values from multiple scan sectors
          o Configure: Set Sick LD sector configuration including field-of-view and scan resolution
    * Matlab Mex interface for acquiring data via both drivers
    * Designed for use under Linux/Unix systems using GNU Autotools
    * Plenty of C++ and Matlab example code
