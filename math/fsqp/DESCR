FSQP is a source code for minimization of the maximum of a set of smooth
objective functions subject to general smooth constraints. Two versions are
available. One written in portable Fortran 77 (FFSQP), and the other written in
portable standard C (CFSQP). This package contains the C version. Both versions
have been tested and run successfully on most platforms, including Sun SPARCs,
DECs, and IBM personal computers. Feedback from users concerning
success/failure on various platforms would be greatly appreciated, as would
suggested fixes in the case of a problem.
