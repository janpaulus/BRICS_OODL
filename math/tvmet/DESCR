tvmet is a vector and matrix library. tvmet means `Tiny Vector and Matrix
template library'. It uses Meta Templates (MT) and Expression Templates (ET) to
evaluate results at compile time -- which makes it fast for low order (tiny)
systems.

"Tiny" is a subjective term, but typically means vectors and matrices of size
ten (10) or less.
