# BUILD_DIRS is the list of directories in which to perform the build
#	process.  If the directories are relative paths, then they
#	are assumed to be relative to ${WRKSRC}.
#
# MAKE_PROGRAM is the path to the make executable that is run to
#	process the source makefiles.  This is always overridden by
#	the tools framework in pkgsrc/mk/tools/make.mk, but we provide
#	a default here for documentation purposes.
#
# MAKE_ENV is the shell environment that is exported to the make
#	process.
#
# MAKE_FLAGS is a list of arguments that is pass to the make process.
#
# MAKE_FILE is the path to the makefile that is processed by the make
#	executable.  If the path is relative, then it is assumed to
#	be relative to each directory listed in BUILD_DIRS.
