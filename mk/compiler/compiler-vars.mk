# This Makefile fragment implements handling for supported C/C++/Fortran
# compilers.
#
# The following variables may be set by the robotpkg user in robotpkg.conf:
#
# ROBOTPKG_COMPILER
#	A list of values specifying the chain of compilers to be used by
#	robotpkg to build packages.
#
#	Valid values are:
#		ccache		compiler cache (chainable)
#		gcc		GNU
#		gcc42		GNU, version 4.2
#
#	The default is "gcc".  You can use ccache with an appropriate
#	ROBOTPKG_COMPILER setting, e.g. "ccache gcc".  The chain should always
#	end in a real compiler. This should only be set in robotpkg.conf.
#
#
# The following variables may be set by a package:
#
# USE_LANGUAGES
#	Lists the languages used in the source code of the package,
#	and is used to determine the correct compilers to install.
#	Valid values are: c, c99, c++, fortran, java, python.  The
#       default is "c".
