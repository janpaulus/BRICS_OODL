# Python language definitions
#
# This file determines which Python version is used as a dependency for
# a package.
#
# === User-settable variables ===
#
# PYTHON_REQUIRED
#	A list of constraints on python version number used to determine the
#	range of allowed versions of python required by a package. This list
#	should contain patterns suitable for evaluation by "robotpkg_admin
#	pmatch", i.e. optionaly start with >,>=,<= or < and followed by a
#	version number (see robotpkg_info(1)). This value should only be
#	appended to by a package Makefile.
#
# === Defined variables ===
#
# PYPKGPREFIX
#       The prefix to use in PKGNAME for extensions which are meant
#       to be installed for multiple Python versions.
#
#       Example: py25
