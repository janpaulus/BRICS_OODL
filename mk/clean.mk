# This Makefile fragment is included to robotpkg.mk and defines the
# relevant variables and targets for the "clean" phase.
#
# The following variables may be set by the package Makefile and
# specify how cleaning happens:
#
#    CLEANDEPENDS specifies the whether "cleaning" will also clean
#	in all dependencies, implied and direct.  CLEANDEPENDS
#	defaults to "no".
#
# The following targets are defined by bsd.pkg.clean.mk:
#
#    clean-depends is the target which descends into dependencies'
#	package directories and invokes the "clean" action.
#
#    do-clean is the target that does the actual cleaning, which
#	involves removing the work directory and other temporary
#	files used by the package.
#
#    clean is the target that is invoked by the user to perform
#	the "clean" action.
#
#    cleandir is an alias for "clean".
#
