# This Makefile fragment is included separately by bsd.pkg.mk and
# defines some variables which must be defined earlier than where
# bsd.install.mk is included.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# INSTALLATION_DIRS_FROM_PLIST
#	If set to "yes", the static PLIST files of the package will
#	be used to determine which directories need to be created before
#	the "real" installation should start.
