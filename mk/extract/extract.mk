# The following variables may be set by the package Makefile and
# specify how extraction happens:
#
# EXTRACT_DIR
#	The directory into which the files are extracted.
#
#	Default value: ${WRKSRC}
#
#    EXTRACT_CMD is a shell command list that extracts the contents of
#	an archive named by the variable ${DOWNLOADED_DISTFILE} to the
#	current working directory.  The default is ${EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT}.
#
#    EXTRACT_OPTS is a list of options to pass to the "extract" script
#	when using EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT.  See the comments at the head of
#	the "extract" script for a definitive list of the available
#	options.  The default list is empty.
#
#    EXTRACT_USING specifies the tool used to extract tar/ustar-format
#	archives when using EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT.  The possible values are
#	"gtar", "nbtar", and "pax".  By default, we use the "nbtar" tool
#	(pkgsrc's pax-as-tar).
#
#    EXTRACT_ELEMENTS is a list of files within the distfile to extract
#	when using EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT.  By default, this is empty, which
#	causes all files within the archive to be extracted.
#
# The following are read-only variables that may be used within a package
#	Makefile:
#
#    DOWNLOADED_DISTFILE represents the path to the distfile that is
#	currently being extracted, and may be used in custom EXTRACT_CMD
#	overrides, e.g.
#
#	    EXTRACT_CMD= ${TAIL} +25 ${DOWNLOADED_DISTFILE} > foo.pl
#
#    EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT uses the "extract" script to unpack archives.  The
#	precise manner in which extraction occurs may be tweaked by setting
#	EXTRACT_OPTS, EXTRACT_USING and EXTRACT_ELEMENTS.
#
