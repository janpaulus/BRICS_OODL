# The following variables may be set by the package Makefile and specify
# how checkout happens:
#
#    CHECKOUT_DIR
#	The directory into which the files are checkout.
#	Default value: ${WRKSRC}
#
#    CHECKOUT_CMD is a shell command list that checkout the contents of a
#	package named by the variable ${CHECKOUT_REPOSITORY} to the current
#	working directory.  The default is ${CHECKOUT_CMD_DEFAULT}.
#
#    CHECKOUT_OPTS is a list of options to pass to the "checkout" script when
#	using CHECKOUT_CMD_DEFAULT. See the comments at the head of the
#	"checkout" script for a definitive list of the available options. The
#	default list is empty.
#
#    CHECKOUT_ELEMENTS is a list of files within the repository to extract when
#	using EXTRACT_CMD_DEFAULT. By default, this is empty, which causes all
#	files within the repository to be extracted.
#
# The following are read-only variables that may be used within a package
# Makefile:
#
#    CHECKOUT_FORMAT is the of the repository that is currently
#	being extracted (e.g. git).
#
#    CHECKOUT_REPOSITORY represents the URL of the repository that is currently
#	being extracted, and may be used in custom CHECKOUT_CMD	overrides.
#
#    CHECKOUT_CMD_DEFAULT uses the "checkout" script to checkout
#	repositories. The precise manner in which extraction occurs may be
#	tweaked by setting CHECKOUT_OPTS and CHECKOUT_ELEMENTS.
