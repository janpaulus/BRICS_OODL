# This Makefile fragment implements a general text replacement facility.
# Package makefiles define a ``class'', for each of which a particular
# substitution description can be defined.  For each class of files, a
# target subst-<class> is created to perform the text replacement.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# SUBST_CLASSES
#	A list of class names. 	A new class name must be appended (+=).
#
# SUBST_STAGE.<class>
#	"stage" at which we do the text replacement. Should be one of
#	{pre,do,post}-{extract,patch,configure,build,install}.
#
# SUBST_MESSAGE.<class>
#	The message to display when the substitution is done.
#
# SUBST_FILES.<class>
#	A list of file patterns on which to run the substitution;
#	the filenames are either absolute or relative to ${WRKSRC}.
#
# SUBST_SED.<class>
#	List of sed(1) arguments to run on the specified files. Multiple
#	commands can be specified using the -e option of sed.
#
# SUBST_FILTER_CMD.<class>
#	Filter used to perform the actual substitution on the specified
#	files.  Defaults to ${SED} ${SUBST_SED.<class>}.
#
# SUBST_POSTCMD.<class>
#	Command to clean up after sed(1). Defaults to ${RM} -f
#	$$file${_SUBST_BACKUP_SUFFIX}. For debugging, set it to ${DO_NADA}.
