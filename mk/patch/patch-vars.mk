# This Makefile fragment is included by robotpkg.mk and defines some
# variables for the patch target.
#
# The following variables may be set in a package Makefile:
#
#    PATCHFILES
#	is a list of distribution patches relative to ${_DISTDIR} that
#	are applied first to the package.
#
#    PATCHDIR
#	is the location of the robotpkg patches for the package. This defaults
#	to the "patches" subdirectory of the package directory.
#

# The default PATCHDIR is currently set in robotpkg.prefs.mk
#PATCHDIR?=	${CURDIR}/patches

_PATCH_APPLIED_FILE=	${WRKDIR}/.patch
_COOKIE.patch=		${WRKDIR}/.patch_done


# --- patch (PUBLIC) -------------------------------------------------
#
# patch is a public target to apply the distribution and pkgsrc
# patches to the extracted sources for the package.
