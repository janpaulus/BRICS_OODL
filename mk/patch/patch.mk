# The following variables may be set in a package Makefile and control
# how robotpkg patches are applied.
#
#    PATCH_STRIP is a patch(1) argument that sets the pathname strip
#	count to help find the correct files to patch.  See the patch(1)
#	man page for more details.  Defaults to "-p0".
#
#    PATCH_ARGS is the base set of arguments passed to patch(1).
#	The default set of arguments will apply the patches to the
#	files in ${WRKSRC} with any ${PATCH_STRIP} arguments set.
#
# The following variables may be set in a package Makefile and control
# how "distribution" patches are applied.
#
#    PATCH_DIST_STRIP is a patch(1) argument that sets the pathname
#	strip count to help find the correct files to patch.  See the
#	patch(1) man page for more details.  Defaults to "-p0".
#
#    PATCH_DIST_ARGS is the base set of arguments passed to patch(1).
#	The default set of arguments will apply the patches to the
#	files in ${WRKSRC} with any ${PATCH_DIST_STRIP} arguments set.
#
#    PATCH_DIST_CAT is the command that outputs the contents of the
#	"$patchfile" to stdout.  The default value is a command that
#	can output gzipped, bzipped, or plain patches to stdout.
#
#    PATCH_DIST_STRIP.<patchfile>
#    PATCH_DIST_ARGS.<patchfile>
#    PATCH_DIST_CAT.<patchfile>
#	These are versions of the previous three variables which allow
#	for customization of their values for specific patchfiles.
#
# The following variables may be set by the user and affect how patching
# occurs:
#
#    PATCH_DEBUG, if defined, causes the the patch process to be more
#	verbose.
#
#    PATCH_FUZZ_FACTOR is a patch(1) argument that specifies how much
#	fuzz to accept when applying pkgsrc patches.  See the patch(1)
#	man page for more details.  Defaults to "-F0" for zero fuzz.
