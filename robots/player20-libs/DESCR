This is the client libraries for player.

Player is a network server for robot control. Running on your robot,
Player provides a clean and simple interface to the robot's sensors
and actuators over the IP network. Your client program talks to Player
over a TCP socket, reading data from sensors, writing commmands to
actuators, and configuring devices on the fly.

Player supports a variety of robot hardware. The original Player
platform is the ActivMedia Pioneer 2 family, but several other robots
and many common sensors are supported. Player's modular architecture
makes it easy to add support for new hardware, and an active
user/developer community contributes new drivers.

Player runs on Linux (PC and embedded), Solaris and *BSD.
