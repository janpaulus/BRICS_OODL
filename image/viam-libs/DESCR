The Versatile Image Acquisition Module handles image acquisition from
firewire DCAM cameras through the libdc1394 and OpenCV libraries. This
module can also read images from files.

Simple filters can be applied to the raw images, like distortion
correction or image rectification for stereo pairs. Gain, exposure, white
balance and other hardware parameters can also be controlled, provided
that the hardware enables it.

An automatized camera calibration procedure usign OpenCV algorithm is
included.

This package contains the core libraries only.
