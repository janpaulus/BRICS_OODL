The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is a method by David Lowe to detect 
feature points in images. These can be matched between images to perform tasks 
such as object detection and recognition, or to compute geometrical 
transformations between images.
This is Robert Hes C implementation of SIFT. It includes is a set of functions 
to compute image transforms from feature matches using RANSAC. In addition to 
features computed from Hess code, these functions also work with image features 
in files from both David Lowe's SIFT detector and the Oxford VGG's affine 
covariant feature detectors.
SIFT code relies on OpenCV library (version 2 or above) and some features 
require GTK.
