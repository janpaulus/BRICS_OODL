The Linux kernel's IEEE 1394 subsystem provides access to the raw 1394
bus through the raw1394 module. This includes the standard 1394
transactions (read, write, lock) on the active side, isochronous stream
receiving and sending and dumps of data written to the FCP_COMMAND and
FCP_RESPONSE registers. raw1394 uses a character device to communicate to
user programs using a special protocol.

libraw1394 was created with the intent to hide that protocol from applications so that

   1. the protocol has to be implemented correctly only once.
   2. all work can be done using easy to understand functions instead of
      handling a complicated command structure.
   3. only libraw1394 has to be changed when raw1394's interface changes.
