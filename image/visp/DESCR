ViSP (ViSP states for "Visual Servoing Platform") is a modular
software that allows fast development of visual servoing applications.

Visual servoing consists in specifying a task as the regulation of a
set of visual features.

Despite all the research in this field, it seems that there is no
software environment that allows fast prototyping of visual servoing
tasks. The main reason is that it usually requires specific hardware
(the robot and specific framegrabbers). The consequence is that the
resulting applications are not portable and can be merely adapted to
other environments. Today's software design allows us to propose
elementary components that can be combined to build portable
high-level applications.

Various issues have thus to be considered in the design of such
applications: among these issues we find the control of robots
motions, the modeling of the visual features, and the tracking of the
visual measurements. Our environment features a wide class of control
skills as well as a library of real-time tracking processes and a
simulation toolkit.

The platform (in fact a library) is implemented in C++ and is
available under Linux, Windows and OSX. We are still in the process of
developing ViSP and are happy to entertain suggestions, have people
test code, etc. You can contact ViSP authors using visp@irisa.fr.

ViSP is developped and maintained by the INRIA Lagadic team located at
INRIA Rennes.
