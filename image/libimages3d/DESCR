This library had originally been written by Simon Lacroix in August. 97
(as a calife library - hence the comments in french), and has been
cleaned and "autotoolized" by Anthony Mallet in August 2006. It defines a
structure ("DATA_IM3D") of 3D points data ("DATA_PT3D"), that contains 3D
points expressed either in cartesian, cylindric of spheric coordinates
systems. The structure can also embed normal and variances informations,
and various functions to manipulate the image and point structures are
provided.

WHAT'S IN THE FILES:

imalloc.c : creation, initialization and destruction of DATA_IM3D

ptalloc.c : creation, initialization and destruction of DATA_PT3D

io.c : file input/output functions

imutil.c : various functions on a DATA_IM3D (compute the bounds on
coordinates, subsamples a DATA_IM3D, frame transformation...)

iminfo.c : prints information on a DATA_IM3D

ptinfo.c : prints information on a given 3D point of a DATA_IM3D

ptutil.c : various functions on a 3D point 

coords.c : conversions between the cartesian, cylindric of spheric coordinates
systems

delaunay.c : computes a delaunay triangulation of a DATA_IM3D

mesh.c : triangulates a DATA_IM3D, filters the resulting mesh and writes an
"OFF" file.


OTHER MISC INFOS (to be completed):

- All the angles are of course manipulated in radians in the code, and
are printed in degrees on the screen ("info" functions).

- sizeof (DATA_PT3D) : 28 bytes without the normal and variances
information, 64 byte with these information.
