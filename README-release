How to release a new version of a package
-----------------------------------------

autotools packages
------------------
In the package 
  - be sure that your working version is up to date.
  - in ChangeLog: add missing commit messages and notify new release 
  - in configure.ac: upgrade the version number 
  - in configure.ac or package.pc.in: upgrade dependency versions
  - cd build; make to check that package compiles
  - cd build; make dist
  - make sure the archive is readable (chmod a+r archivename.tar.gz)
  - look into robotpkg package Makefile,
  - if MASTER_SITES=${MASTER_SITE_JRL}
      ftp softs.laas.fr, login jrl
      > put nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz
  - if MASTER_SITES= ${MASTER_SITE_OPENROBOTS:=directory/}
      scp nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz softs.laas.fr://www/htdocs/openrobots/distfiles/directory/.

In openrobots/robotpkg/.../package
  - update Makefile with new version number
  - make mdi
  - make install
  - make print-PLIST builds the list of files and directories to be destroyed when deinstalling.
  - edit PLIST.guess and remove irrelevant lines.
  - mv PLIST.guess PLIST
  - make clean to remove build directory.
  - commit the modifs.
    - prefix commit message by [category/package],
    - insert list of changes from ChangeLog in commit body message.

In the package
  - commit and push
  - add a tag.
    - git-tag -m "release x.y" x.y
  - increment version number as x.y.99
  - git commit 
  - git-push --tags

cmake packages
--------------

In the package 
  - be sure that your working version is up to date.
  - make a temporary branch: git checkout -b release-x.y
  - in ChangeLog: add missing commit messages and notify new release 
  - in CMakeLists.txt: upgrade the version number 
  - in CMakeLists.txt: upgrade dependency versions
  - cd build; rm -rf *; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp ..; make install to check that package compiles
  - git commit -a
  - git archive --format=tar --prefix=nameofthepackage-x.y/ HEAD | gzip > nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz
  - make sure the archive is readable (chmod a+r nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz)
  - look into robotpkg package Makefile,
  - if MASTER_SITES=${MASTER_SITE_JRL}
      ftp softs.laas.fr, login jrl
      > put nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz
  - if MASTER_SITES= ${MASTER_SITE_OPENROBOTS:=directory/}
      scp nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz softs.laas.fr://www/htdocs/openrobots/distfiles/directory/.

In openrobots/robotpkg/.../package
  - update Makefile with new version number
  - make mdi
  - make install
  - make print-PLIST builds the list of files and directories to be destroyed when deinstalling.
  - edit PLIST.guess and remove irrelevant lines.
  - mv PLIST.guess PLIST
  - make clean to remove build directory.
  - commit the modifs.
    - prefix commit message by [category/package],
    - insert list of changes from ChangeLog in commit body message.

In the package
  - add a tag.
    - git-tag -m "release x.y" x.y
  - merge branch release-x.y into master
  - increment version number as x.y.99
  - git commit 
  - git-push --tags

Important
---------

It is recommended to do one commit by package upgraded. It is then easier to trace 
back the changes in each package.
